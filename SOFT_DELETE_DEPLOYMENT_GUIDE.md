# üöÄ Complete Deployment Guide: Day Soft Delete & Cascade Features

## üìã **Deployment Summary**

All changes have been committed and pushed to GitHub. The deployment includes:
- ‚úÖ Backend soft delete implementation
- ‚úÖ Database migration scripts  
- ‚úÖ Updated OpenAPI documentation
- ‚úÖ UI implementation prompt

**GitHub Commits**:
- `93bbf10` - Initial soft delete implementation
- `2f7346e` - Fix DayStatus enum values to match database
- `04de93f` - Update OpenAPI documentation

## üóÑÔ∏è **Database Deployment**

### **1. Run Database Migrations**
```sql
-- Add deleted_at column to stops table
ALTER TABLE stops ADD COLUMN deleted_at DATETIME NULL;

-- Update DayStatus enum to include DELETED (uppercase values)
ALTER TABLE days MODIFY COLUMN status ENUM('ACTIVE', 'INACTIVE', 'DELETED') NOT NULL DEFAULT 'ACTIVE';
```

### **2. Verify Database Changes**
```sql
-- Check stops table has deleted_at column
DESCRIBE stops;

-- Check days status enum includes DELETED
SHOW COLUMNS FROM days LIKE 'status';

-- Should show: enum('ACTIVE','INACTIVE','DELETED')
```

## üîß **Backend Deployment**

### **1. Pull Latest Code**
```bash
cd /path/to/your/production/backend
git pull origin main
```

### **2. Restart Backend Service**
```bash
sudo systemctl restart dayplanner-backend.service
sudo systemctl status dayplanner-backend.service
```

### **3. Verify Backend Changes**
```bash
# Test stops summary includes days count
curl "https://mytrips-api.bahar.co.il/stops/{trip_id}/stops/summary" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}"
# Should include "days": number field

# Test routing summary includes status
curl "https://mytrips-api.bahar.co.il/routing/days/{day_id}/active-summary" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}"
# Should include "status": "ACTIVE" field

# Test day deletion
curl -X DELETE "https://mytrips-api.bahar.co.il/trips/{trip_id}/days/{day_id}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}"
# Should return 204, day should disappear from subsequent GET requests
```

## üìö **Documentation Deployment**

### **1. Swagger UI Updates**
The OpenAPI documentation has been updated with:
- ‚úÖ DayStatus enum now includes `DELETED` with uppercase values
- ‚úÖ StopsSummary schema includes `days` field
- ‚úÖ DayRouteActiveSummary schema includes `status` field

### **2. Access Updated Documentation**
- **Swagger UI**: `https://mytrips-api.bahar.co.il/docs`
- **ReDoc**: `https://mytrips-api.bahar.co.il/redoc`
- **OpenAPI JSON**: `https://github.com/AdarBahar/MyTrip/blob/main/backend/docs/openapi.json`

## üé® **UI Deployment**

### **1. Critical UI Updates Required**
The UI team needs to implement changes from `UI_SOFT_DELETE_IMPLEMENTATION_PROMPT.md`:

**Immediate (Breaking Changes)**:
- Update day status comparisons from lowercase to uppercase
- Handle new API response fields

**Feature Implementation**:
- Day deletion dialog with reorder/rest day options
- Updated error handling for deleted days

### **2. UI Testing Checklist**
- [ ] Day status displays correctly (ACTIVE/INACTIVE)
- [ ] Day deletion shows proper options
- [ ] Stops summary shows days count
- [ ] Routing summary shows day status
- [ ] No errors with deleted days

## üß™ **Testing & Verification**

### **1. Backend API Testing**
```bash
# Test 1: Day deletion cascade
DELETE /trips/{trip_id}/days/{day_id}
# Verify: Day and all stops are soft deleted

# Test 2: Stops summary
GET /stops/{trip_id}/stops/summary
# Verify: Response includes "days" field

# Test 3: Routing summary  
GET /routing/days/{day_id}/active-summary
# Verify: Response includes "status" field

# Test 4: Filtering
GET /trips/{trip_id}/days
# Verify: Deleted days don't appear
```

### **2. Database Verification**
```sql
-- Check soft deleted days
SELECT id, status, deleted_at FROM days WHERE deleted_at IS NOT NULL;

-- Check soft deleted stops  
SELECT id, day_id, deleted_at FROM stops WHERE deleted_at IS NOT NULL;

-- Verify cascade deletion worked
SELECT 
  d.id as day_id,
  d.status,
  d.deleted_at as day_deleted,
  COUNT(s.id) as remaining_stops
FROM days d 
LEFT JOIN stops s ON d.id = s.day_id AND s.deleted_at IS NULL
WHERE d.deleted_at IS NOT NULL 
GROUP BY d.id;
-- Should show 0 remaining_stops for deleted days
```

## üîÑ **Rollback Plan**

If issues occur, rollback in this order:

### **1. Backend Rollback**
```bash
# Revert to previous commit
git checkout 5111557  # Previous stable commit
sudo systemctl restart dayplanner-backend.service
```

### **2. Database Rollback**
```sql
-- Remove new column
ALTER TABLE stops DROP COLUMN deleted_at;

-- Revert enum (update any DELETED status first)
UPDATE days SET status = 'INACTIVE' WHERE status = 'DELETED';
ALTER TABLE days MODIFY COLUMN status ENUM('active', 'inactive') NOT NULL DEFAULT 'active';
```

## üìä **Expected Behavior After Deployment**

### **‚úÖ Day Deletion**
- Sets `status = "DELETED"` and `deleted_at` timestamp
- Cascade soft deletes all associated stops
- Day disappears from all GET endpoints
- Route versions are cleaned up

### **‚úÖ API Responses**
- Stops summary includes active days count
- Routing summary includes day status
- All endpoints filter deleted records
- Proper error handling for missing days

### **‚úÖ Data Integrity**
- Soft deleted records preserved for audit
- No data loss during deletion
- Consistent filtering across all endpoints
- Recovery possible by clearing `deleted_at`

## üéØ **Success Criteria**

**Backend**:
- [ ] Day deletion returns 204 status
- [ ] Deleted days don't appear in GET requests
- [ ] Stops summary includes days count
- [ ] Routing summary includes status
- [ ] No 500 errors in logs

**Database**:
- [ ] Migration completed successfully
- [ ] Soft deleted records have timestamps
- [ ] Cascade deletion working properly
- [ ] No orphaned data

**Documentation**:
- [ ] Swagger UI shows updated schemas
- [ ] DayStatus enum includes DELETED
- [ ] New fields documented properly

**UI** (After Implementation):
- [ ] No JavaScript errors
- [ ] Day status displays correctly
- [ ] Deletion dialog works properly
- [ ] New API fields handled correctly

## üìû **Support & Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

**1. "LookupError: 'active' not found in enum"**
- **Cause**: UI sending lowercase status values
- **Fix**: Update UI to use uppercase values

**2. "Day not found" errors**
- **Cause**: UI trying to access deleted days
- **Fix**: Refresh trip data, handle 404 errors

**3. Missing days/stops count**
- **Cause**: API response structure changed
- **Fix**: Update UI to handle new response fields

### **Monitoring**
- Watch application logs for errors
- Monitor API response times
- Check database for orphaned records
- Verify soft delete timestamps are set

## üéâ **Deployment Complete**

The soft delete system is now fully implemented and ready for production use. The system provides:

- **Robust day deletion** with cascade to stops
- **User-friendly deletion options** (reorder vs rest day)
- **Data preservation** through soft delete
- **Consistent API behavior** with proper filtering
- **Enhanced API responses** with additional metadata

All changes are backward compatible except for the day status enum values, which require UI updates.
