# üîß Day Soft Delete and Cascade Fixes - Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ **Changes Made**

### **1. Enhanced Day Status Enum**
- **File**: `backend/app/models/day.py`
- **Change**: Added `DELETED = "DELETED"` to `DayStatus` enum
- **Impact**: Days can now have status "DELETED" in addition to "ACTIVE" and "INACTIVE"

### **2. Added Soft Delete to Stop Model**
- **File**: `backend/app/models/stop.py`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `SoftDeleteMixin` import and inheritance
  - `Stop` model now supports soft deletion with `deleted_at` field
- **Impact**: Stops can be soft deleted instead of hard deleted

### **3. Implemented Proper Cascade Soft Deletion**
- **File**: `backend/app/api/days/router.py`
- **Changes**:
  - Day deletion now sets `status = DayStatus.DELETED`
  - Cascade soft deletes all associated stops
  - Cascade deletes all associated route versions (hard delete for now)
- **Impact**: When a day is deleted, all related data is properly handled

### **4. Enhanced Stops Summary Endpoint**
- **File**: `backend/app/api/stops/router.py`
- **File**: `backend/app/schemas/stop.py`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `days` field to `StopsSummary` schema
  - Endpoint now returns count of active days
  - Filters stops by `deleted_at.is_(None)`
- **Impact**: `/stops/{trip_id}/stops/summary` now includes active days count

### **5. Enhanced Routing Active Summary**
- **File**: `backend/app/schemas/route.py`
- **File**: `backend/app/api/routing/router.py`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `status` field to `DayRouteActiveSummary` schema
  - Both single and bulk endpoints return day status
- **Impact**: `routing/days/{day_id}/active-summary` now includes status

### **6. Updated All Endpoints to Filter Deleted Records**
- **Files**: Multiple router files
- **Changes**:
  - All stop queries now filter by `Stop.deleted_at.is_(None)`
  - All day queries already filtered by `Day.deleted_at.is_(None)`
- **Impact**: Deleted stops and days won't appear in API responses

### **7. Enhanced Bulk Operations**
- **File**: `backend/app/services/bulk_operations.py`
- **Changes**:
  - Bulk delete now uses soft delete when available
  - Falls back to hard delete for models without soft delete
- **Impact**: Bulk operations respect soft delete patterns

### **8. Updated Stop Schema**
- **File**: `backend/app/schemas/stop.py`
- **Changes**:
  - `Stop` schema now inherits from `BaseResponseWithSoftDelete`
  - Includes `deleted_at` field in API responses
- **Impact**: Stop responses include soft delete information

## üóÑÔ∏è **Database Migration Required**

### **Migration File**: `backend/alembic/versions/002_add_soft_delete_to_stops_and_deleted_status.py`

**Changes**:
1. **Add `deleted_at` column to `stops` table**
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE stops ADD COLUMN deleted_at DATETIME NULL;
   ```

2. **Update `DayStatus` enum to include `DELETED`**
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE days MODIFY COLUMN status ENUM('ACTIVE', 'INACTIVE', 'DELETED') NOT NULL DEFAULT 'ACTIVE';
   ```

## üöÄ **Deployment Steps**

### **1. Run Database Migration**
```bash
cd backend
alembic upgrade head
```

### **2. Restart Backend Service**
```bash
sudo systemctl restart dayplanner-backend.service
```

### **3. Test the Changes**
```bash
# Test day deletion
curl -X DELETE "https://mytrips-api.bahar.co.il/trips/{trip_id}/days/{day_id}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}"

# Test stops summary with days count
curl "https://mytrips-api.bahar.co.il/stops/{trip_id}/stops/summary" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}"

# Test routing active summary with status
curl "https://mytrips-api.bahar.co.il/routing/days/{day_id}/active-summary" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}"
```

## üìã **Expected Behavior After Deployment**

### **Day Deletion**:
- ‚úÖ Day `deleted_at` field is set to current timestamp
- ‚úÖ Day `status` changes to "deleted"
- ‚úÖ All associated stops are soft deleted
- ‚úÖ All associated route versions are deleted
- ‚úÖ Day won't appear in GET requests (filtered by `deleted_at`)

### **API Responses**:
- ‚úÖ Stops summary includes active days count
- ‚úÖ Routing active summary includes day status
- ‚úÖ All endpoints filter out deleted stops and days
- ‚úÖ Soft deleted records have `deleted_at` timestamp in responses

### **Database State**:
- ‚úÖ Deleted days: `deleted_at` set, `status = 'deleted'`
- ‚úÖ Deleted stops: `deleted_at` set
- ‚úÖ Records remain in database for audit/recovery purposes

## üîç **Verification Queries**

```sql
-- Check deleted days
SELECT id, status, deleted_at FROM days WHERE deleted_at IS NOT NULL;

-- Check deleted stops
SELECT id, day_id, deleted_at FROM stops WHERE deleted_at IS NOT NULL;

-- Verify cascade deletion worked
SELECT 
  d.id as day_id, 
  d.status, 
  d.deleted_at as day_deleted,
  COUNT(s.id) as remaining_stops
FROM days d 
LEFT JOIN stops s ON d.id = s.day_id AND s.deleted_at IS NULL
WHERE d.deleted_at IS NOT NULL 
GROUP BY d.id;
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes**

1. **Backward Compatibility**: All existing endpoints continue to work
2. **Data Integrity**: Soft delete preserves data for audit purposes
3. **Performance**: Queries now filter by `deleted_at` - ensure indexes exist if needed
4. **Recovery**: Deleted records can be recovered by setting `deleted_at = NULL`
5. **Route Versions**: Currently hard deleted - consider adding soft delete if needed

## üéØ **Issues Fixed**

- ‚ùå **Before**: Days showed `status: "active"` even after deletion
- ‚úÖ **After**: Days show `status: "deleted"` and are filtered from responses

- ‚ùå **Before**: Stops remained visible after day deletion
- ‚úÖ **After**: Stops are cascade soft deleted and filtered from responses

- ‚ùå **Before**: Stops summary didn't include days count
- ‚úÖ **After**: Stops summary includes active days count

- ‚ùå **Before**: Routing summary didn't include day status
- ‚úÖ **After**: Routing summary includes day status

- ‚ùå **Before**: Inconsistent filtering across endpoints
- ‚úÖ **After**: All endpoints consistently filter deleted records
