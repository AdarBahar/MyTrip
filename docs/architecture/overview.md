# Architecture Overview

## System Architecture

RoadTrip Planner is built as a modern, scalable web application with a clear separation between frontend and backend components.

### Technology Stack

#### Frontend
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui
- **State Management**:
  - TanStack Query (server state)
  - Zustand (client state)
- **Maps**: MapTiler SDK JS
- **Forms**: React Hook Form + Zod validation

#### Backend
- **Framework**: FastAPI (Python 3.11)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 16 + PostGIS 3
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy 2 with Alembic migrations
- **Validation**: Pydantic v2
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens (planned)
- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger

#### Infrastructure
- **Containerization**: Docker + Docker Compose
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension
- **Routing**: GraphHopper (cloud or self-hosted)
- **Maps**: MapTiler for tiles and geocoding

### Core Components

#### 1. Trip Management
- **Purpose**: Manage trip lifecycle and collaboration
- **Features**:
  - Trip creation and editing
  - Member management with roles
  - Publishing and sharing
  - Soft deletion and archiving

#### 2. Route Planning
- **Purpose**: Plan and optimize routes between stops
- **Features**:
  - Multiple routing profiles (car, motorcycle, bike)
  - Route alternatives and versioning
  - Real-time route computation
  - Route optimization options

#### 3. Day Organization
- **Purpose**: Organize trips into daily segments
- **Features**:
  - Sequential day management
  - Rest day support
  - Stop management per day
  - Notes and metadata

#### 4. Place Management
- **Purpose**: Manage locations and points of interest
- **Features**:
  - Geocoded place storage
  - Place sharing between trips
  - Custom place creation
  - Integration with external geocoding

#### 5. Collaboration
- **Purpose**: Enable team collaboration on trips
- **Features**:
  - Role-based access control
  - Real-time updates (planned)
  - Comment system (planned)
  - Activity tracking (planned)

### Data Flow

#### Route Computation Flow
1. User selects stops for a day
2. Frontend sends route computation request
3. Backend validates stops and day
4. Routing provider computes route
5. Preview returned with temporary token
6. User can commit route as new version
7. Route stored with full metadata

#### Trip Collaboration Flow
1. Trip owner invites members via email
2. Invitation sent with role assignment
3. Member accepts invitation
4. Member gains access based on role
5. Changes tracked and synchronized

### Security Considerations

#### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication (planned)
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- API key management for external services
- Secure session management

#### Data Protection
- Input validation with Pydantic
- SQL injection prevention via ORM
- XSS protection in frontend
- CORS configuration
- Rate limiting (planned)

### Scalability Considerations

#### Database
- Proper indexing for spatial queries
- Connection pooling
- Read replicas for scaling reads
- Partitioning for large datasets

#### API
- Stateless design for horizontal scaling
- Caching strategies (Redis planned)
- Background job processing (Celery planned)
- API versioning support

#### Frontend
- Code splitting and lazy loading
- CDN for static assets
- Service worker for offline support (planned)
- Progressive Web App features (planned)

### Monitoring & Observability

#### Logging
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Different log levels for environments
- Centralized log aggregation (planned)

#### Metrics
- Application performance monitoring
- Database query performance
- External service response times
- User interaction analytics (planned)

#### Health Checks
- Database connectivity
- External service availability
- Application health endpoints
- Automated alerting (planned)
