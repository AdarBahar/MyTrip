## üîß **Usage Guidelines**

### **Adding New Features**
1. **Start Simple:** Implement the minimum viable solution
2. **Document Purpose:** Clearly state what the component does
3. **Avoid Over-Engineering:** Don't add features "just in case"
4. **Test Thoroughly:** Ensure the simple solution works well

### **Modifying Existing Code**
1. **Maintain Simplicity:** Don't add complexity without clear need
2. **Update Documentation:** Keep purpose statements current
3. **Consider Removal:** Ask if features are actually needed
4. **Test Impact:** Ensure changes don't break existing functionality

### **Code Review Checklist**
- [ ] Is the component's purpose clear?
- [ ] Is the implementation as simple as possible?
- [ ] Is the documentation helpful?
- [ ] Are there any unnecessary features?
- [ ] Does it follow existing patterns?
