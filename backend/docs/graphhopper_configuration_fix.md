# GraphHopper Configuration Fix

## Issue
Route optimization was failing with 500 errors due to GraphHopper Cloud rate limiting.

## Root Cause
The backend was configured to use GraphHopper Cloud API which has rate limits, causing 429 errors that resulted in 500 Internal Server Errors.

## Solution
Switched to self-hosted GraphHopper configuration:

### Environment Variables (.env)
```bash
# Routing Configuration
GRAPHHOPPER_MODE=selfhost
USE_CLOUD_MATRIX=false
GRAPHHOPPER_API_KEY=cdab50b7-2d77-4db2-a067-d99a2f63d32f
GRAPHHOPPER_BASE_URL=http://graphhopper:8989  # Self-hosted GraphHopper
```

### Previous Configuration (Rate Limited)
```bash
GRAPHHOPPER_MODE=cloud
GRAPHHOPPER_BASE_URL=https://graphhopper.com/api/1  # Cloud API with rate limits
```

## Container Restart Required
After changing .env file, the backend container must be recreated to pick up new environment variables:

```bash
docker-compose down backend
docker-compose up -d backend
```

## Verification
- Health check shows: `"routing_mode": "selfhost"`
- Route optimization works without rate limit errors
- GraphHopper container must be running on port 8989

## Status
✅ Fixed and operational
✅ Route optimization working
✅ No rate limit issues
